## Hi there 👋

Hello! I am 21 years old computer science student, studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am keen on programming in general, I like mobile, web (front-end and back-end) development. Also, I have interest in data science - from data processing and visualization to machine learning. Apart from my passion for technology, in my free time I make music, do sports and like to cook sometimes.🍝

This is my personal github account, for my university account look to the links in my profile.
